        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The &lt;head&gt; element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the &lt;head&gt; are not visible when a user looks at a webpage. </li>
          <li>The &lt;body&gt; element contains the content that is shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
          <li>&lt;DOCTYPE&gt; is not case-sensitive because it is a declaration. Declarations are not case-sensitive; HTML elements are case-sensitive.</li>
          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. If there are three elements nested inside of a &lt;body&gt; element, those three nested elements are known as child elements. The element that holds all the children—in this case, the &lt;body&gt; element—is known as the parent element. This “parent/child” language is often used by developers to explain the relationship among elements in HTML.</li>
          <li>The &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;, &lt;h4&gt;, &lt;h5&gt;, and &lt;h6&gt; elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents. When using headings, it is important that we use heading tags in order from &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt; to make the page accessible to users who access the page using screen readers or other devices. In addition, the biggest heading, &lt;h1&gt;, should only appear once on each page.</li>
          <li>The &lt;p&gt; element represents a paragraph or block of text. This element is used extensively to wrap most of the text on webpages.</li>
          <li>The &lt;img&gt; element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The &lt;img&gt; element can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image. Example:
            <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1177303291034619904/1177303305102311555/image.png?ex=65720425&is=655f8f25&hm=48125471da7f3346871819a748012b21e0510d30288b93c868ec4829a10c3f58&"/> 
          </li>
          <li>The &lt;br&gt; element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>the &lt;a&gt; element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link. Example:
            <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1177303291034619904/1177304381411033149/image.png?ex=65720525&is=655f9025&hm=44b9d65426cfac469bf4e35dae61c48b99649d943c1c7de241d1457f777e23d8&"/>
