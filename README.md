# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The motivation for the creation of the Prework Study Guide Webpage was learning basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git, and utilising what I learnt by making notes in a way that requires practising concepts covered during the learning process. Updating the notes this way can be seen as practice of these concepts, and it is exactly how it tackles the often occuring problem of forgetting what one had learnt.

The Prework Study Guide contains some notes on learning the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git that can be studied. Also, by opening the DevTools console, the JavaScript code randomly chooses one topic to learn for the undecided.
